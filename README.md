# ExtensibleCR
This package includes a hybrid robotic software package for extensible continuum robots.
More specifically, the package consists of a ROS-based kinematics simulator for 
prototyping of backbone-based extensible continuum manipulators and concurrently a 
control implementation for physical prototypes is provided.


## Kinematics Package

The Kinematics package contains the kinematic description, instantaneous kinematics and models 
of the multisegmental extensible continuum robot.  


## Joint_Controller Package

The Join_Controller package interfaces low level actuation in the Actuator_Controller package
and the Kinematics Package

## Main_Controller Package

## Motionplanning Package
